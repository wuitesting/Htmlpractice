How to Interact with the App:

Browse Poses:
You'll see sections for "Beginner," "Intermediate," and "Advanced" poses.
Each pose card has a name, description, and controls for Reps (repetitions) and Mins (duration).
Adjust Reps (for dynamic poses like Cat-Cow) or Mins (for held poses like Downward Dog) as desired for that specific instance.
Click "Add to Playlist" to add the configured pose to your session list.
Your Yoga Playlist:
As you add poses, they will appear in this section.
You can remove items using the "Remove" button next to each.
The "Start Playlist Session" button will become active once you have at least one pose.
Exercise Session:
Click "Start Playlist Session" to begin.
The YouTube video will load and play (muted), the pose name and instructions will appear, and voice guidance will begin.
The timer will count down for the set duration/reps.
Controls:
Pause/Resume: Pauses or resumes the timer, video, and voice guidance.
Next Pose: Skips to the next pose in your playlist.
End Session: Stops the current session entirely and returns you to the main sections.
Global Controls (at the top):
Session Video Speed: Adjusts the playback speed of all YouTube videos in the session.
Toggle Voice (ON/OFF): Turns the voice guidance on or off.
Back to Playlist: After a session ends (either by completing all poses or manually ending), this button will appear, allowing you to go back and create a new playlist or modify your existing one.
This comprehensive single-file web app should give you a great starting point for your voice-guided yoga practice!
